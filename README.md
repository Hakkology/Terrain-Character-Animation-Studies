# Terrain-Character-Animation-Studies

Unity based game scripts. Unfortunately, some of the assets were corrupted after drive failure, so im merely keeping the scripts.

Here, critter movement based on NavMesh (wolf companion and free rabbits) and character movement is implemented.
Using terrain tool for Unity, beautiful surroundings were created.
Third person character movement is utilized with two seperate stances, combat and walk stances.
Finally, character was given a weapon as a sword and hit animations were tested.
A three-hit combo was implemented using random assets and animations from Mixamo.
